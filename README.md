# I don't know what to put here...
Hello, I'm ChipCruncher, usually shortened to "Chip" and I write software!\
I don't usually post my work to github unless I really want to show it off or whatever.

One repository that I am working on fairly frequently atm is [TheGameOrSmth](https://github.com/ChipCruncher72/TheGameOrSmth) (sorry for the name)\
It is planned to become a RPG-style game about AI generated art and the problems with it (It's won't be a massive commentary I promise)

Other than that some of my other interests are:
- Furries
- Pok√©mon
- Japanese
- Music

to name a few\
my social media is linked on my profile if you want to check them out
